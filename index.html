      <p class="prose">
        I once had to shave my hair as a school uniform requirement at Maganjo primary school.<br>
        I blame my fiesty nature to the socialization and cold weather at <span class="highlight">Naromoru girls </span>where i went to highschool.<br>
        i was a great debator, still am, and a class prefect for three years. <br>
        Here i was second in my class of 121 girls with a B+ worth 73 points. <br>
        It is at <span class="highlight"> Dedan Kimathi university of technology</span> where i majored in <span class="highlight">BSc. Information technology
        </span>that i got into cool student organizations and communities where i grew so much, intellectually.
        <span class="highlight">I graduate in April 2020.</span>
      </p>

    <div id="Skills">
      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p class="prose">I rock at project management a skill i have sharpened while volunteering as a meetup faccilitator

      <p class="prose">
        <h4>Politics</h4>
      If i wasn't sitting behind this laptop, i would be at a political rally somewhere.
      <br>
      <span class="highlight">I am Kenyan and Kenya is my business</span>
      <br>

      <h4>Economics</h4>
      It is imperative for every inhabitant of this planet to understand the workings of it's economies, right?
      <br>

      <h4>Feminism</h4>
      I am a proud feminist. Our reproduction should have nothing to do with
      how society percieves us. Gender should never be a limit for any human being.
